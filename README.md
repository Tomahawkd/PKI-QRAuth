### Contribution

1. Fork the project

2. Contribute code

3. **Check repo update and merge into your code**

4. pull request

### Note

1. With the summer internship ends, the repo will hardly be updated. And I will maintain the repo from time to time when I get free.

2. Considering the effeciency of the authentication server, I would transfer to use TCP protocol by project [netty](https://github.com/netty/netty) for smaller transfering bytes and higher performance.
